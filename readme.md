## Demo

## Installation

```sh
cargo install cai
```


## Usage

Before using Cai, an API key must be set up.
Simply execute `cai` in your terminal and follow the instructions.

Cai supports the following APIs:

- **Groq** - [Create new API key](https://console.groq.com/keys).
- **OpenAI** - [Create new API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- **Anthropic** -
    [Create new API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
- **Llamafile** - Local [Llamafile] server running at http://localhost:8080.
- **Ollama** - Local [Ollama] server running at http://localhost:11434.

Afterwards, you can use `cai` to run prompts directly from the terminal:

```sh
cai List 10 fast CLI tools
```

Or a specific model, like Anthropic's Claude Opus:

```sh
cai op List 10 fast CLI tools
```

Full help output:

```txt
$ cai help
Cai 0.11.0
